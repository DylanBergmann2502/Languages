# A charlist is a list of integers.
# The integers represent the Unicode values of a given character â€” also known as code points.
# If a list of integers contains only integers
# that are code points of printable character,
# it will be displayed as a charlist. Even if it was defined using the [] syntax.
IO.puts [65, 66, 67] # ABC
IO.inspect [65, 66, 67] # ~c"ABC"

# If a list of integers contains even one code point
# of an unprintable character (e.g. 0-6, 14-26, 28-31),
# it will be displayed as a list. Even if it was defined using the~c"" syntax.
IO.inspect ~c"ABC\0" # [65, 66, 67, 0]
IO.inspect [65, 66, 67, 0] # [65, 66, 67, 0]

# Printability can be checked with List.ascii_printable?.
List.ascii_printable?([65, 66, 67]) # true
List.ascii_printable?([65, 66, 67, 0]) # false

# They are strictly equal

# When printing a list with IO.inspect,
# you can use the :charlists option to control how lists are printed.
